  - Animal
  - Biological
- Monitoring

## Pipeline
The pipeline is a task management and scheduling application. The main purpose of this is to run continuous integration and deployment process. 

For the behavioral aspect of the pipeline application, please check (here)[https://github.com/rstens/lucy-web/blob/dev/PIPELINE.md].

The application source code resides in /api/.pipeline (api, db and tools)and /app/.pipeline (app) directory. 

### Various Features of the application
- Build API (Build API Image in OpenShift Tool Namespace)
- Build APP (Build APP Image in OpenShift Tool Namespace)
- Build Tools (Schemaspy, DB Backup tools in OpenShift Tool Namespace)
- Pull DB image (To OpenShift Tool Namespace)
- Run DB Backup (All ENV)
- Deploy DB (All ENV)
- Setup DB (Run DB migration process) (All ENV)
- Seed DB (For Test and Dev Env) 
- Test API (Dev Only)
- Deploy API (All ENV)
- Deploy APP (All ENV)
- Deploy Tools (All ENV)
