## Introduction

Invasive species are non-native plants and animals whose introduction and spread in British Columbia cause significant economic, social or environmental damage. This application tracks the observation, treatment, and monitoring of invasive species in the Province of British Columbia.

This project is part of the Species and Ecosystems Information System Modernization (SEISM) program.

## Project Status

This application is in active development and has not yet been released.

## Audience

Anyone with a valid IDIR or BCeID login may access the application to view data that is being tracked.

In addition, the application is intended for use by:

* Surveyors who observe and record the absence, presence, and spread of invasive species
* Subject matter experts who perform a variety of duties, including to record and analyze data and create action plans
* Contractors who implement recommended treatments for observed invasive species
* Administrators who manage the application and its users

## Features

This application is anticipated to include the following main features:

1. Support for IDIR and BCeID access
1. User roles and permissions management
1. Interactive maps displaying multiple data layers
1. Observations of invasive species absence/presence
1. Recommendations, planning, and application records of treatments
1. Monitoring of treatment outcomes
1. Query and export of data
1. Auditing and reports
1. Bulk data entry and mobile device data entry

## Architecture

This application uses PostgreSQL (with PostGIS), TypeORM, and Angular. Containers are built using Jenkins pipelines and Docker. Our environments run on an OpenShift container platform cluster.

* [Pipeline](PIPELINE.md)
* Our database is documented using [SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.org/)
* [Load Test](loadTest/README.md)

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) installed.
* The ability to run Makefile commands, using a command line tool such as [GMAKE](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

On Windows, you may require a tool like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) in order to use the Makefile.

If you wish to deploy the application, you will also need to install [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html).

## Setup Instructions

Begin by cloning the repository to create a local copy. The repository on GitHub provides instructions: https://github.com/rstens/lucy-web

All subsequent commands are run at the project root.

For example:

`git clone https://github.com/rstens/lucy-web`

`cd lucy-web`

Finally, create initial local environment files:

1. Create an empty `.env` file at the `api` directory root
1. Within `api/env_config` create a `env.local` file, using `env.example` as a reference
1. Update the app secret values in `env.local`

Note: these files are git-ignored.

## Running the Application

*Using Docker:*

The client (frontend app) and server(s) (backend api/api-mobile) of the application run in separate containers. To run all of the application containers, use the following commands:

* Run the appliation containers  
`make local`

* Run the application containers in debug mode  
   `make local-debug`  
   This will print additional logging statements to the console, which may be useful when debugging the backend.  

* Close and clean the application containers  
   `make clean-local`  
   This will close and remove the containers and images created by either of the above commands.

   _Note: See the `Makefile` for the full list of commands._ 

To run a subset of the application contains, refer to the `README` and `Makefile` in their respective sub-folders (ie: `./api` or `./api-mobile`).
